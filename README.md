Coffee-JVM: A JVM in Coffeescript
=================================
[Mid-term project](http://plasma.cs.umass.edu/emery/grad-systems-project-1) 
for [CS 691ST, Spring 2012](http://plasma.cs.umass.edu/emery/grad-systems).

Use [Coffeescript v1.2.0](http://coffeescript.org/) (which is the default version you get from npm).
Run `coffee --watch */*.coffee` to auto-gen scripts as you go, and don't check in any JS!

TODOs
-----
 - choose a sexier name
 - everything else (populate this with things as they arise)

=================================
[Mid-term project](http://plasma.cs.umass.edu/emery/grad-systems-project-1) 
for [CS 691ST, Spring 2012](http://plasma.cs.umass.edu/emery/grad-systems).

Use [Coffeescript v1.2.0](http://coffeescript.org/) (which is the default version you get from npm).
Run `coffee -wc */*.coffee &` to auto-gen scripts as you go.

TODOs
